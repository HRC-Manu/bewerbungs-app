# Project Plan: AI-Powered Job Application Assistant

## 1. Requirements Analysis and Conceptual Design
- Clarify the specific needs and requirements of the user's friend
- Define functional and non-functional requirements based on his needs
- Consider future scalability as a non-functional requirement
- Select technologies that enable easy scalability
- Design a scalable system architecture (e.g. microservices or serverless)
- Create a basic data model
- Sketch user interface concept based on the friend's preferences

## 2. Set up Development Environment  
- Create repository on GitHub
- Install required tools and libraries
- Set up basic project structure
- Define a simple development workflow

## 3. Implement Core Functionality
- Input forms for job posting and CV
- Extraction of data from uploaded PDFs
- Integration of ChatGPT API for cover letter and CV generation
- Preview of generated documents
- Export functions for PDF and Word
- Use scalable data stores (e.g. NoSQL databases or object storage)
- Decouple frontend and backend (e.g. through APIs)
- Implement caching and asynchronous processing where applicable

## 4. Integrate Additional APIs
- Check with the friend if additional APIs like DeepL are needed
- If required, integrate them into the application flow
- Adapt user interface if needed

## 5. Design User Interface
- Design structure and navigation of the interface based on the friend's feedback
- Implement individual screens with HTML/CSS
- Add basic interactions and transitions with JavaScript 
- Ensure compatibility with the friend's devices

## 6. Testing and Quality Assurance
- Perform essential functionality tests
- Conduct manual tests of the user interface with the friend
- Fix identified bugs
- Optimize performance if needed
- Implement monitoring to identify bottlenecks
- Automate tests and deployment

## 7. Deployment and Commissioning
- Select a hosting solution that allows for easy scaling 
- Containerize the application (e.g. with Docker)
- Set up the environment 
- Deploy the application
- Perform basic tests and final acceptance with the friend
- Provide instructions for use and support

## Next Steps
- Discuss the detailed requirements with the user's friend
- Prioritize features based on his needs
- Create a timeline for regular feedback cycles
- Schedule regular sync meetings with the friend to discuss progress and incorporate his feedback
- Start with the requirements analysis and conceptual design

## 8. Prioritize work packages and define dependencies
- Estimate efforts for each package
- Create concrete timeline with milestones
- Schedule regular sync meetings to discuss progress, adjust priorities and identify issues early
- Use this plan as a guide and adapt flexibly to new insights
